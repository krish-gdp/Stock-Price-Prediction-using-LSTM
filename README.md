Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM 
Goal of the project is to predict the stock price of a company.
Here, the prediction of the stock prices is done based on the closing values of the past 150 days.
The model is created using the stacked LSTM layers by importing the necessary APIs.
We performed the model using  stacked LSTM's because it increases the ability of our model to understand more complex representation of our time-series data in hidden layers, by capturing information at different levels.
We used the model to predict the future prices of the company for the next 30 days.
